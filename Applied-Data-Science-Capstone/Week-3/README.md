# Introduction

We will convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longtitude values. At the same time we will work with Forsquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto as we did before for NY. Also we will use the **explore** function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, afterward we will use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. For that we gonna use *k*-means clustering algorithm to complete also we will get benefits from Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto.
